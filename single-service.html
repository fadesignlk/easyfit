            <h2>Masonry Services</h2>
            <h5>"MASONRY AS YOUR CHOICE‚Äù</h5>

            <div>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Masonry means the construction of walls, stairs, and pillars of a building, bridge, dam, canal,
                    barrage, and abutments. Masonry work is merely concerned with the construction of a vertical
                    structure. The common masonry materials are bricks, granite stone, marble, limestone, concrete
                    blocks, glass blocks, adobe, and cast stone. <br><br>

                    Easyfit only use highly experienced masons in our professional masonry team. We can meet all your
                    masonry work need such Block Works, Plastering Works, etc... <br><br>

                    <strong>Block work wall: </strong>
                    Block work walls are typically constructed in wet sites, and the underwater section is constructed
                    from mass (plain) concrete blocks with an in-situ concrete cap for the upper section of the
                    structure. The precast blocks are typically founded on a stone bed and terminate in the tidal zone.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Plastered masonry: </strong>
                    Plaster is a thin layer of mortar applied over the masonry surface and it acts as a damp-proof coat
                    over the brick masonry work. Plastering also provides a finished surface over the masonry that is
                    firm and smooth hence it enhances the appearance of the building. <br><br>

                <h6>Types of Masonary</h6>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The masonry material is bonded by means of mortar of cement, lime-stone, and clay. There are several
                    types of masonry based on the type of material, and method of construction. <br><br>
                    <strong> Stone Masonry: </strong>
                    In stone masonry, stones of different types, like marble, granite, sandstone, limestone, and cast
                    stones are used to construct the walls. The best bonding material for stone masonry is the mortar
                    of cement and limestone-sand. The durability of a stone is higher than that of bricks and blocks.
                    However, some of the stones have heavyweight. In a building of multi-story, stones like granite
                    are not recommended, due to their heavy weight.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Brick Masonry: </strong>
                    Bricks are of different types, like clay bricks, kiln burnt bricks, fly-ash bricks, concrete bricks,
                    and
                    engineering bricks. Among these types of bricks, the most common and often recommended bricks
                    are the kiln bricks. The durability and cost affordability of these bricks is better than other
                    types
                    of bricks. These bricks are comparatively lighter than the stones like granite, marble, sandstone,
                    and cast stones. The masonry work of the bricks is easier and faster then that of other masonry
                    materials.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Block Masonry: </strong>
                    Blocks are made up of concrete. The liquid concrete is poured into a frame-chamber and
                    compressed. The compression increases the compaction and strength of the block. Blocks are of
                    different types, like hollow concrete blocks, concrete stretcher blocks, concrete corner blocks,
                    concrete pillar blocks, etc. Each type of block is used as per the requirement.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Concrete Bags Masonry:</strong>
                    A bagged concrete masonry is very easy and less time-consuming. It also does not require any
                    specific skilled labor for carrying out the construction. The plastic fiber bags filled with the
                    concrete material are compiled upon one another, and afterward, the water is poured on the bags
                    of the concrete to prevent drying soon. On drying and hardening, the concrete of all the bags gets
                    stuck with one another.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Gabion Masonry:
                    </strong>
                    A gabion wall is a retaining wall. Mostly a gabion wall is used in holding behind the soil, water,
                    other material. A gabion wall consists of stones piled upon one another and are tied with wires.
                    The wire does not allow the stones to dismantle. Most of the gabion walls are not vertically stood,
                    but rather they are slope back-side, so that the stones may not exert pressure (caused by soil) on
                    the wires.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Composite Masonry:</strong>
                    A composite masonry is a type of masonry work carried out with two or more than two building
                    units or materials. For example, we can install veneer sheathing on the walls constructed with
                    bricks or blocks. Sometimes the hollow blocks are covered with a thin layer of brick masonry.
                    Composite masonry is carried out for strengthening and providing durability to the structure.
                    However, the cost of the construction gets higher, then the single-unit masonry. In case of
                    preventing the building from weathering and chemical and water attack, the walls are covered with
                    stone, marble, and veneer sheathing. <br><br>

                    <strong>Reinforced Masonry:
                    </strong>
                    When steel rods or cables are placed in the concrete structure, it is called a reinforced masonry. A
                    reinforced masonry cost, a bit, higher, but the strength of such types of masonry is invincible. The
                    labor cost and the time saving is also appreciated in this type of masonry.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Veneer Masonry:
                    </strong>
                    Veneers are flat panels of wood, plastic or fiber. Walls constructed with Masonry veneer consist
                    of a single non-structural external layer of masonry, typically made of brick, stone or manufactured
                    stone. Masonry veneer can have an air space behind it and is technically called "anchored veneer".
                    A masonry veneer attached directly to the backing is called an "adhered veneer".
                    <br><br>
